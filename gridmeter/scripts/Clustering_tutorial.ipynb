    "\n",
    "The `gridmeter` library originated from a project lead by Recurve Analytics, Inc. and funded by the US Dept. of Energy designed to identify practical methods for analyzing energy efficiency which are robust to external shocks (e.g. COVID-19).  From June through September 2020, Recurve hosted a series of meetings with industry stakeholders to discuss methods for constructing comparison groups, with the goal of presenting a recommended standard method to the GRID working group, a subsidiary of the Linux Foundation for Energy.  During this time, Recurve developed Python software to implement stratified sampling and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.  The `gridmeter` library is the open-source Apache-licensed output of this process and is available to be used by anyone. \n",

    "This tutorial assumes the reader has properly installed python and has a basic working knowledge of python syntax and usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `gridmeter` library uses `pandas` data frames as its principle way of representing data, therefore all inputs and outputs are data frames; see [this tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) for information on how to use `pandas`.  The `plotnine` library is used to make visualizations which can be embedded in a Jupyter notebook or saved as .pngs; see [this website](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for information on `plotnine`."

    "\n",
    "Typically one begins with two populations of meters: a **treatment group**, and a **comparison pool**.  The treatment group consists of those meters for which savings needs to be tracked, e.g. if they represent customers participating in an energy efficiency program.  The comparison pool consists of all of the available meters that are not part of the treatment group.  The goal is to select a **comparison group** which is a subset of the comparison pool, such that the control group is **similar** to the treatment group.  The comparison group will then provide a realistic counterfactual compared to the treatment group and can be used to accurately estimate the impact of a program."

    "Ordinarily you would start with your own time-series meter data, but for our purposes we'll generate some very basic dummy data.  `gridmeter` provides some functions which generate populations of dummy meters with randomly varying base and peak usage levels.  We'll use the following code to generate a population of 1000 treatment meters and 10000 comparison pool meters, and specify some consumption values for the treatment group that differ from the default, so that the groups are differently distributed.  The treatment group is specified by filtering the comparison pool along one of the available features (currently `winter_usage`, `summer_uage`, and `annual_usage`).  For this example, we'll assume our treatment group targets customers with usage above the 50th percentile in both summer and winter.\n",

    "Once the population has been generated, we can create feature data and longitudinal data.  These functions take a few minutes to run upon first execution, but the results are cached to disk so subsequent runs will be fast.\n",

    "Gridmeter uses the `Data` class as the inputs to all of the comparison group methods. Its purpose is to validate your data and to perform the necessary transformations to go into the comparison group methods. `Data` is instantiated with `Data_Settings`. Once instantiated the method `.set_data` can be called using one of `loadshape_df` and `time_series_df` as well as `features_df` depending upon your needs. If you input `time_series_df` it will compute the loadshape.\n",

Other techniques such as principle component analysis could be useful as well.  In general, aim for stratifying on between one and three features, and aim for orthogonal features if possible.  In the dummy data, there are three features available: `summer_usage`, `winter_usage`, and `annual_usage` which are shown in the scatter plots below.  `annual_usage` is correlated with the other two, as you would expect, so we will stratify based on `summer_usage` and `winter_usage`.\n",
