Adopted `<date>`


This charter (the "Charter") sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for
technical contribution to, and oversight of, the [OpenEEMeter], which has been
established as [OpenEEMeter] a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the "Project").
LF Projects, LLC ("LF Projects") is a Delaware series limited liability
company. All Contributors to the Project must comply with the terms of this
Charter.

1) Mission and Scope of the Project
-----------------------------------

a) The mission of the Project is to develop an open source project with the
following goals:

- i) Build and maintain an open source engine for quantifying the change in energy
  consumption attributable to specific interventions at the utility meter in
  order to enable the rapid diffusion of distributed energy resources;
- ii) Maintain a production-ready project to define consistent transactional units
  for distributed energy resources in markets and expand capabilities over
  time;
- iii) Ensure transparency and trust by providing open source code that enables
  reliable validation and mutual accountability in energy markets;
- iv) Provide reusable components with documented APIs and consistent security
  practices; and
- v) Develop an ecosystem of developers, suppliers, OEMs, systems integrators,
  and customers all using this common platform as the basis to define common
  transactional units for distributed energy resources in the market.

b) The scope of the Project includes software development under OSI-approved
open source licenses supporting the mission, documentation, testing,
integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development,
deployment, operation or adoption of the open source software project.

2) Techincal Steering Committee
-------------------------------

a) The Technical Steering Committee (the "TSC") will be responsible for all
technical oversight of the open source Project.

b) Composition

- 1) "Startup Period": During the initial twelve (12) months after project
  launch or for such time period as the TSC may otherwise approve, the TSC
  voting members will be determined by the Project’s Committers at the time of
  Project creation.
- 2) "Steady State": After the Startup Period, there will be a nomination and
  election period for electing Contributors or Committers to the TSC. The TSC
  voting members will consist of elected Contributors or Committers chosen by
  the Committers, as defined herein. The TSC will approve the process and
  timing for nominations and elections held on an annual basis, and will decide
  the long-term size of the TSC.

c) At an appropriate time (e.g., after the first release), the TSC shall approve
a transition plan to transition the TSC from the Startup Period to Steady
State.

d) The list of current TSC voting members shall be maintained with the
[MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS.md) file within the Project’s code repository.  The
TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members
of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the
MAINTAINERS file.  Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are
intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via
teleconference, or in person.

e) TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may
adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING
file. Unless otherwise documented:

- i) Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code,
  documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project;
- ii) Committers are Contributors to whom the Project has granted the privilege of
  modifying ("committing") source code, documentation or other technical
  artifacts directly in a Project repository; and ..
- iii) A Contributor may become a Committer by a three-quarter majority of the
  existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of
  the other existing Committers.

f) Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is
open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter and abide by
the Project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

g) The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the prioritization,
submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements
for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and
(3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and
Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as
it sees fit.

h) The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and
will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC.  The TSC Chair,
or any other TSC member so designated by the TSC, will serve as the primary
communication contact between the Project and LF Energy as the Project's
representative to the TAC.

i) Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight
relating to the Project, which may include:

- i) coordinating the technical direction of the Project;
- ii) approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to,
  incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope);
- iii) organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;
- iv) creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project
  technical issues and requirements;

  representative to participate in the LF Energy Technical Advisory Council
  (TAC);
- vii) establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue
  reporting policies;
- viii) approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be
  published in the project repository) and coordinating with the Series Manager
  to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of
  this Charter;
- ix) discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical
  matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and
- x) coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project
  with the LF Projects Manager or their designee.
