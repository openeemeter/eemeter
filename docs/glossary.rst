.. _glossary-baseline:

- **baseline**: a pre-intervention reference point or starting point from
  which to compare post-intervention
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>`.


.. _glossary-baseline-period:

- **baseline period**: a time period before a
  :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>` of interest for which to model, observe,
  or estimate :ref:`energy performance <glossary-energy-performance>`.
  Generally used in reference to a
  :ref:`reporting period <glossary-reporting-period>` or set of reporting
  periods.


.. _glossary-building-performance:

- **building performance**: see :ref:`energy performance <glossary-energy-performance>`.


.. _glossary-demand-capacity:

- **demand capacity**: the extent to which
  :ref:`energy-performance <glossary-energy-performance>` increases from a
  baseline for a :ref:`reporting period <glossary-reporting-period>`
  following an :ref:`intervention <glossary-intervention>`.


.. _glossary-demand-response-project:

- **demand response project**: a set of
  :ref:`interventions <glossary-intervention>` designed to shift the time of
  day or day of week of
  :ref:`energy-demand <glossary-energy-demand>`, generally toward off-peak
  hours.


.. _glossary-end-use:

- **end use**: an energy-consuming service such as lighting, space cooling,
  space heating, refrigeration, or water heating, particularly as provided by
  a building or set of buildings.


.. _glossary-end-use-demand:

- **end use demand**: the extent to which an :ref:`end use <glossary-end-use>`
  is needed. May vary by season, occupancy, time of day, day of week, or
  purpose of building.


.. _glossary-energy-demand:

- **energy demand**: the amount of energy needed to satisfy
  :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>`.


.. _glossary-energy-efficiency-project:

- **energy efficiency project**: a set of
  :ref:`interventions <glossary-intervention>` designed to reduce overall
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>` relative to
  equivalent :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>`.


.. _glossary-energy-model:

- **energy model**: a mathematical description of
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>`, particularly
  in response to :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>` scenarios.


.. _glossary-energy-savings:

- **energy savings**: an increase in
  :ref:`energy performance <glossary-energy-performance>`
  indicating lower :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>` for
  *equivalent* :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>`.


.. _glossary-energy-performance:

- **energy performance**: the extent to which
  :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>` causes
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>`. Higher performance
  indicates lower energy demand for *equivalent* end use demand. Sometimes
  referred to as :ref:`building performance <glossary-building-performance>`.


.. _glossary-energy-trace:

- **energy trace**: see :ref:`trace <glossary-trace>`


.. _glossary-intervention:

- **intervention**: a set of upgrades or performance improvements on physical
  infrastructure of an existing building
  (see :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>`), or of behavior of individuals
  living in an existing building.


.. _glossary-projected-baseline-energy-demand:

- **projected baseline energy demand**: a counterfactual estimate of
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>` as it might have been under
  a particular :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>` scenario had an
  intervention not occurred.


.. _glossary-project:

- **project**: an :ref:`intervention <glossary-intervention>` or
  :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>` for which there is an expected change in
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>`.


.. _glossary-reporting-period:

- **reporting period**: a time period after a
  :ref:`retrofit <glossary-retrofit>` of interest over which to model,
  observe, or estimate :ref:`energy performance <glossary-energy-performance>`.
  Generally used in reference to a
  :ref:`baseline period <glossary-baseline-period>`.


.. _glossary-retrofit:

- **retrofit**: a set of :ref:`interventions <glossary-intervention>` taking
  place at a particular building or site which modify pre-existing
  structures, installations or appliances.


.. _glossary-trace:

- **trace**: a single time series of measured values associated with units at
  a particular (not necessarily fixed) frequency.


.. _glossary-trace-interpretation:

- **trace interpretation**: the meaning of the trace data. Possible
  interpretations are outlined in :ref:`eemeter-structures`


.. _glossary-typical-meteorological-year-3:

- **Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3)**: A set of
  `publicly available <http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/>`_
  :ref:`weather normals <glossary-weather-normal>` designed by the National
  Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Used by EEMeter for
  :ref:`weather normalization <glossary-weather-normalization>`.


.. _glossary-weather-normalization:

- **weather normalization**: a technique to account for differences in
  :ref:`end use demand <glossary-end-use-demand>` due to variations in weather
  patterns which uses a model of weather-dependent
  :ref:`energy demand <glossary-energy-demand>` to determine a counterfactual
  energy demand under a weather conditions described by a
  :ref:`weather normal <glossary-weather-normal>`.


.. _glossary-weather-normal:

- **weather normal**: a set of (not necessarily observed) weather data
  designed to reflect a "typical" weather scenario. Often covers a time
  period of 1 year. Used in
  :ref:`weather normalization <glossary-weather-normalization>`.
  See :ref:`TMY3 <glossary-typical-meteorological-year-3>`.

.. _glossary-zip-code-tabulation-area:

- **ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)**: a set of geographical areas based on
  US Postal Service (USPS) ZIP codes, necessitated by the fact that ZIP codes
  do not map easily onto geographies. Built and maintained by the US Census
  Bureau. Contains only about three quarters of valid ZIP codes. ZIP code and
  ZCTA do not always match.
